Moon Missions v2.92
===================
My take on a lunar lander game, for the Pico-8.

Features:
---------
  - One obnoxious flying saucer
  - A catchy intro tune
  - Semi-procedural levels
  - Persistent high scores

Directions:
-----------
Try to land your lunar vehicle on the surface of the moon while keeping an eye on your fuel
and landing speed. Do your part to advance science (and boost your high score) by passing 
through each level's "data" waypoints. Keep an eye out for alien interface!

Tip 1: When your landing speed is too high to land, warning lights flash from within your ship.
Tip 2: Keep your eyes out for each level's fuel cannister to get some extra range and boost your score.
