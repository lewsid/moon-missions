Moon Missions
==============
My take on a lunar lander game, for the Pico-8.

Features:
---------
  - A catchy intro tune
  - One obnoxious flying saucer
  - Semi-procedural levels
  - Persistent high scores
  - Addictive gameplay

Directions:
-----------
Try to land your lunar vehicle on the surface of the moon while keeping an eye on your fuel
and landing speed. Do your part to advance science (and boost your high score) by passing 
through each level's "data" waypoints. Keep an eye out for alien interface!

Controls:
---------
Up/Left/Right to control directional thrusters
